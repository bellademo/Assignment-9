## Developing Data Products Project

### Part 1: Shiny Application

1.  Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.

2.  Deploy the application on R studio's shiny server.

3.  Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box.

4.  Share your server.R and ui.R code on github.

### Part 2: Reproducible Pitch

1.  5 slides to pitch your idea done in Slidify or R studio Presenter.

2.  Presentation pushed to either github or Rpubs.

3.  A link to github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box.

## Iris Data Set Information

This data set details the measurements of sepal length/width and petal length/width of three different species of Iris: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.   

The sepal and petal length variables were extracted for this analysis.

---

## Relationship Between Sepal Length and Petal Length

Through exploratory analaysis, we can see that there is a general positive relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length in all of the species. We can also see a pattern with the setosa species having relatively shorter lengths compared to the longer lengths associated with the virignica species. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Petal.Length, fill= Species)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())

```

## Shiny Application

The application: <https://bella789.shinyapps.io/Course-9-Project/>

This application looks at the relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length in different species of Irises: setosa, veriscolor, and virginica. It allows us to look deeper into how these variables are associated in the context of certain species. 

The application contains a regression analysis between Sepal Length and Petal Length for each species respectively. Additionally, it provides a summary containing more detailed information about the relationship.
